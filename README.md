Smartwatch Data Analysis Project
Author: Mithun Kodandera
Organization: Envision Virtue

Overview
This project involves analyzing smartwatch data to uncover insights into health and fitness patterns. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the creation of visualizations to identify trends and provide actionable insights.

Objective
The primary goal is to generate a comprehensive report based on smartwatch data to understand user behavior, fitness patterns, and potential areas for health improvement.

Key Features
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicate entries, and erroneous data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing key trends in activity, sleep, and health metrics.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features that enhance model performance or offer unique insights.
Visualization: Detailed charts and plots to highlight significant patterns and findings.
Recommendations: Insights derived from data analysis to help improve health and fitness strategies.
